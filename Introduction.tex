 \section{Problem}
 State the problem, what will be difficult ? For what is it ? where should it be improved
 
 Problems found so far:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item How to calculate Height out of Pressure/Temp/Humidity Fabian version: $44330 * (1 - (\frac{pressure}{101325})^{ \frac{1}{5.255}})$
  \item How to parameterize the different sensors (Measuring, Test Flight, Data Sheet ) ? 
  \item How to fuse together Data from Sensors that have different Taus, especially those who are slower than the Loop-Time ?
  \item How to integrate AirBreaks/Drag Force of Air/ Trust of Motor a input value?
  \item What are the different noise factors and when do they occur ?
  \item The up-flight is rather short: about 25 seconds, so the Fusion should have a small settling time
  \item The Micro-Chip on which it is used is no the fastest : 168 MHz clock
  \item The Ram on the Chip is not endless: Maximal space for the Sensor fusion is about 10kB
  \item The Sensor Fusion should be as modular as possible so that it also can be used in the next competition
  \item The Sensor Fusion has to be as sturdy as possible so that it will not fail if a problem occurs
  \item The Fusion should make a state Estimation as precise as possible.
  \item There are a lot of different variables: 3 Positions, 1 Speed, 3 Accelerations, 3 Lagen, Time, Pressure, Tempterature, Humidity, Up-/Downforce.
  \item Especially the Input Value u which is the force onto the rocket is difficult to define (Drag, Trust = acceloration depends on wheigt which changes over time).
  \item The different Sensor have different weaknesses: \begin{itemize}
							 \item Accelerometer: Offset, drift, weak to vibrations
                                                         \item Gyro: Weak to Vibrations
                                                         \item Barometer: Many uncertenties, unpercise
                                                         \item GPS: Slow (max 5Hz)
                                                        \end{itemize}
                                                        
								  
 \end{itemize}
