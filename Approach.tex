  How I want to get to the Solution and why I choosed it also how it works.
  
  \section{Tipps}
  - Don't forget point of origin / reference system
  
  \subsection{Barometer}
  -Use density as a statevector \\
  -Use exponential atmosphere method. \\
  -Increasing the R measurement noise matrix when rocket is ascending access the rising uncertainties
  
  
  \section{Possibilities}
  Which ones are there and what are their positives and negatives, in short how do they work
  
  \section{Choosing}
  Why i choosed Kalman Filter
  
  \section{Explenation}
  How it 'should' work in detail
