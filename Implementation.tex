How it will be Implemented
MQTT !!!
\section{Tipps/Notes}
make plots from the different sensors and the log data to show how it was 
produced an how it resembles the real data.


\section{Sensor Model}
How do i model the different sensors to mimic the real sensors as good as possible.

\subsection{Accelorometer}
\subsection{Gyrometer}
\subsection{Pressure}
\subsection{GPS}

\section{System Model}
6*6 with moving point mass and temperature.
4*4 with just temperature.
3*3 just moving point mass.

\section{Simulation}
The simulation will be implemented in matlab
or is already with the different system models.
