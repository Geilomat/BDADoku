How it will be Implemented
MQTT !!!
\section{Tipps/Notes}
make plots from the different sensors and the log data to show how it was 
produced an how it resembles the real data.


\section{Sensor Model}
How do i model the different sensors to mimic the real sensors as good as possible.

\subsection{GPS}
\subsubsection{Perfect Signal}
The perfect GPS signal is rather simple to generate out of the trajectory. For this, just the sampling time has to be adjust.
A suitable sampling rate would be between 0.5 and 2 Hz. To maintain the vectors length which simplifies the later use in the estimation algortihm,
the signal is aquired with a zero order hold convertion like this:

% Add code for the zero order Holde convertion

\subsubsection{Noise}
The noise capacites of GPS is not real white. It more resembles a brown noise because it has a slow ocsillation over it.
I have to determine how i will remodel this in perticular.

\subsubsection{Real Signal}
\subsection{Accelorometer}

\subsection{Gyrometer}
\subsection{Barometer}

\section{System Model}
6*6 with moving point mass and temperature.
4*4 with just temperature.
3*3 just moving point mass.

\section{Simulation}
The simulation will be implemented in matlab
or is already with the different system models.
