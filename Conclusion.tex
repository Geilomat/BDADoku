\section{Derived Solution}
Here comes the best finded state estimator loop/solution and how an why it works
Again Just a quick reminder due the main solution derivision was made in the tests.


\section{Comparison Solution/Requirements}
Compare the derived solution to the requirements

\section{Outlook}
Different things which can be done differently in the future
- Exctented Kalman filter
- More better documented test flights.
- Back calculation for later mesurements espacially GPS measurements
- Slower sampling

\section{Thanks}
Thanks to the Aris Team espacially Thomas and Fabian
Also Thanks to Lukas and Papa Moll

And to the EPFL team for the test flight data
